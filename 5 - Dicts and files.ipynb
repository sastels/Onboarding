    "## Dict Hash Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's efficient key/value hash table structure is called a \"dict\". The contents of a dict can be written as a series of key:value pairs within braces { }, e.g. dict = {key1:value1, key2:value2, ... }. The \"empty dict\" is just an empty pair of curly braces {}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking up or setting a value in a dict uses square brackets, e.g. dict['foo'] looks up the value under the key 'foo'. Strings, numbers, and tuples work as keys, and any type can be a value. Other types may or may not work correctly as keys (strings and tuples work cleanly since they are immutable). Looking up a value which is not in the dict throws a KeyError -- use \"in\" to check if the key is in the dict, or use dict.get(key) which returns the value or None if the key is not present (or get(key, not-found) allows you to specify what value to return in the not-found case)."

Once you've read in the whole file, you can look up any ip address and instantly see its list of lines. The dictionary takes in scattered data and make it into something coherent."
