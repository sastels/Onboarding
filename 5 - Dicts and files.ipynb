    "## Dict Hash Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's efficient key/value hash table structure is called a \"dict\". The contents of a dict can be written as a series of key:value pairs within braces { }, e.g. dict = {key1:value1, key2:value2, ... }. The \"empty dict\" is just an empty pair of curly braces {}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking up or setting a value in a dict uses square brackets, e.g. dict['foo'] looks up the value under the key 'foo'. Strings, numbers, and tuples work as keys, and any type can be a value. Other types may or may not work correctly as keys (strings and tuples work cleanly since they are immutable). Looking up a value which is not in the dict throws a KeyError -- use \"in\" to check if the key is in the dict, or use dict.get(key) which returns the value or None if the key is not present (or get(key, not-found) allows you to specify what value to return in the not-found case)."

Instead identify just a first milestone, e.g. \"well the first step is to extract the list of words.\" Write the code to get to that milestone, and just print your data. Once the milestone code is working, you can work on code for the next milestone. Being able to look at the printout of your variables at one state can help you think about how you need to transform those variables to get to the next state. Python is very quick with this pattern, allowing you to make a little change and run the program to see how it works. Take advantage of that quick turnaround to build your program in little steps."
